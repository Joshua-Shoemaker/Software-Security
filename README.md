# Software-Security

- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
  - Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in financial planning. They sought to improve the security of their software, particularly encrypting sensitive data, and ensuring compliance with industry regulations.

- What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  - I effectively identified key vulnerabilities in encryption, API security, and secure communications. Secure coding prevents data breaches, protects client information, and ensures regulatory compliance. Strong security practices enhance customer trust and reduce financial and reputational risks.

- Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  - Ensuring proper encryption implementation and secure key management was both challenging and insightful. Testing vulnerabilities through static security testing and manual code reviews provided valuable hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating risks.

- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  - I added TLS encryption for secure communication, AES-256 for data protection, and SHA-256 for integrity verification. In the future, I would use automated security scanning tools, manual code reviews, and compliance frameworks like OWASP and NIST to guide mitigation techniques.

- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  - I performed functional testing to validate that the software operated correctly after security enhancements. Automated security scans and manual reviews ensured that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  - I used encryption best practices, TLS protocols, hashing for integrity checks, and automated security testing tools. Following OWASP Top 10 and NIST guidelines will continue to be useful in future projects.

- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  - I would showcase my vulnerability assessment report, encryption implementation, and secure API communication techniques. These demonstrate my ability to identify security risks, implement best practices, and ensure compliance with industry standards.
